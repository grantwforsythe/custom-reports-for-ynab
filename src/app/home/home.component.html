    I officially became a YNABer back in 2024 and have been hooked ever since. I believe YNAB to be
    a great product; however, I find the reports feature to be lacking even with the
    <a href="https://www.toolkitforynab.com/"> Toolkit for YNAB</a> which is why I started this
    project. I hope others will deprive some use from it as well.
