## Raising Pull Requests

- Please keep the PRs small and focused on one thing
- Link to an open issue. If one does not already exist, create it
- Please follow the format of creating branches
  - feat/[feature name]: This branch should contain changes for a specific feature
    - Example: feat/new-chart
  - fix/[bug name]: This branch should contain only bug fixes for a specific bug
    - Example: fix/bug-1

## Commit Message Format

All commit messages must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard, which is enforced by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/). (The styling of commit messages is enforced because the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grantwforsythe/custom-reports-for-ynab/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is autogenerated by [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/conventional-changelog).
